# Game-Mod-Q4-F23

Hello and welcome to Alex's Mod II (Not Fun), the hit sequel to the unreleased cult classic Alex's Mod (Fun).
This mod serves as a recreation of Metroid Prime within the confines of Quake 4.

There are four beams:
-Power Beam
-Wave Beam
-Ice Beam
-Plasma Beam
Each beam has a regular and charged shot.
Right-clicking with any beam will fire a misisle. This can be charged for a super missile.

Press c to go into morph ball mode. You can leverage this to reach into smaller areas.
You can press shift+space+A or shift+space+D to dash either left or right. Use this to avoid damage in combat!

Health works a little differently. It is split into two numbers. The right one that goes up to 99 is your current health bar. The one on the left shows which health bar you are on and your maximum number of health bars.
When a health bar goes to 0, you will go to your next health bar.

There are several item upgrades to pick up.
Missile tanks will increase your maximum missile ammo.
Energy tanks will increase your maximum number of health bars.
Space jump will allow you to jump an additional time in the air.
Morph ball bomb will allow you to lay bombs in morph ball mode.
Varia suit will half the amount of damage you take.
